        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Hanh the founder of HLDesigns. I believe in helping my clients grow their business’ by
          providing them with a strong visual brand foundation so that all design remains consistent throughout. My
          diverse background in all aspects of the creative process brings a unique and fun edge to everything I
          produce. From research and brainstorming to production, I enjoy the journey of bringing brands to life.</p>

        <P>I'm an award-winning artist and designer from Seattle, WA. As a talented and trained artist and painter, I
          attended University of Washington, Seattle where I earned my BA in Fine Art. After graduating at the
          top of my class, I drove my little fiat cross-country to the Southern California where I have worked for
          Mattel, Urban Decay Cosmetics and many other well-known companies.</P>

        <p>I have an extensive background in concept design, marketing communication and brand development across all
          design & marketing platforms. My work is original, innovative and visually attractive.</p>

        <p>Today, I've launched my own brand design studio, EyeSavvy Design, where I plan to build strong relationships
          with my clients as well as teach and sell my online courses on branding, art and design.</p>

      <h3>WHY BRANDING IS SO IMPORTANT</h3>
      <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

      <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
