        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Hanh! Welcome to my page where I will attemt to bore you with my long life-story and some of
          my personal art. Ready?</p>

        <p>Twenty years ago, if I told an adult I wanted to be an artist because I was passionate about
          art, they would
          have laughed at me. They would ask what I knew about passion at such young age, and I would be unable to
          answer. Perhaps I found my passion for art by gazing at my father’s brush strokes for hours before my mother told me
          to  go to sleep. Or perhaps it started with the pure feeling of happiness looking at my doodles being displayed on
          the fridge. Growing up in Vietnam in a tiny one bedroom house where I shared a room with my father, mother and
          brother, I witnessed magic happed every day when my parents turned white paper into masterpieces, captured
          real life objects with only a canvas, brushes and a few bottles of paint. I cannot remember a day of my childhood
          without a crayon, a piece of paper, and an effort to create my own magic. </p>

      <p>But life is not magic. “Life is a rocky road with many crossroads. Passion is your map, follow it,
        determination is your ride, it will get you there,” my mother would often tell me. I did not fully understand
        her words until my rocky road found me two days after my 15th birthday, when my biological parents showed up at
        the door in Vietnam, and I was convinced that it was my opportunity to pursue a better future in a developed
        country. Four months later, I arrived in Los Angeles, California, and within a month, I was a new student at La
        Puente High School. I was unprepared and had to face the biggest challenge - For the first time in my life, I
        experienced racism. At that time, I could only speak Vietnamese in an entirely English-speaking school. Due to
        the language barrier, I was cut off from the rest of society. I soon became the target of daily bullying by
        classmates and sometimes, even teachers. The difficulties of transitioning to the United States seemed
        insurmountable. The culture shock and cruelty at school was a heavy burden for not only me, but also my parents,
        whose work caused them to be absent often. Eventually, I could take no more and returned to
        Vietnam to stay with my grandmother. Despise the pain and embarrassment, the experience gave me a renewed
        ambition to learn English; so I
        could pursue my artistic passion in the United States.</p>

      <p>With a drive to succeed, I returned to the States a year later only to be struck with yet another barrier.
        According to California law, I could not go back to high school, because I had already turned 18 years old.
        Thus, I moved to Seattle, Washington where I lived with my aunt who was teaching Vietnamese courses at the
        University of Washington. I attended Chief Sealth High School, and what I found there was simply amazing. Not
        only was the school diverse, but there was also a Vietnamese-Chinese club, which I soon joined and volunteered
        in the community, enabling me to gain experiences and broaden my cultural spectrum. Finally, my hard work to
        learn English had been rewarded.</p>

      <p>My journey from the doodles on the fridge in Vietnam to the art classrooms at University of Washington began
        with my enrollment to the Associate of Arts Transfer Degree at South Seattle Community College. During my time
        in college, I worked part-time as a publication commissioner at the Women’s Center through my work-study. My
        view of academia and the United States expanded as I met many new people from a variety of cultures, people like
        me who were having difficulty building a life in a country where their mother languages were not understood. Not
        only was I fortunate enough to be exposed to a variety of human characters, enabling me to understand different
        patterns of thought, which set individuals apart, I also learned about myself through a different perspective,
        taking my cultural pride to a more knowledgeable level. Finally, I stopped feeling embarrassed about my own
        accent and found a home in the state of Washington.</p>
